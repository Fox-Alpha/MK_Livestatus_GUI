You can add hooks for as many keys as you would like, just add them like above. Don't get frustrated if you add a hook for a key and it doesn't work, 
many of them, like Keys.Shift show up as other more specific keys, like Keys.LShiftKey or Keys.RShiftKey. Keys.Alt shows up as Keys.LMenu or Keys.RMenu, 
Keys.Control shows up as Keys.LControl or Keys.RControl, just to name a few.
